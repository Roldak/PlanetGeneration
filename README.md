# PlanetGeneration
Procedural generation of planets (or asteroids, etc.) using Unity.

## Techniques used:
* 3D fBm using 3D Perlin noise
* Procedural sphere generation from cube normalization allowing easy UV mapping
* Vertex displacement using the 3D fBm
* Numerical computation of vertex position's derivates to compute vertex normals

## Screenshots:
